- useEffect is executed only after the component renders
- used to perform any side effects such as data fetching, event listeners, timers/intervals, clean-up operations


what is a sideeffect?
-------------------------
- The primary purpose of a component is to render a modal-static
- All functions like onclick, onnavigate etc are all called form the render, so they do not qualify as a side-effect
-whereas data fetching is called as a side effect because 
  - they are not directly related to component render
  - something that will happen later in the component and not during the initial render process. 

useEffect can be used to synchronise the prop values.

when we specify the dependency array in the useEffect react will execute this only when the values in the useEffect changes.
